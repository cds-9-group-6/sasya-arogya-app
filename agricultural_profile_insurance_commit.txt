feat: Integrate agricultural profile with insurance - Add farmer name and farm size

ðŸŒ¾ Agricultural Profile Enhancements for Insurance Integration

Problem Statement:
Insurance operations needed farmer name and farm size data, but these were not being
captured or passed from the agricultural profile. This led to:
- Insurance certificates without proper farmer names (showing 'Farmer' or 'N/A')
- Farm size not being used as fallback when not specified in insurance prompts
- Lack of personalization in insurance documents

Requirements Implemented:

1. Optional Farmer Name Field
   - Added farmer name as optional input in agricultural profile dialog
   - Stored securely in SharedPreferences
   - Only saved if user provides it (optional field)

2. Insurance Integration with Farmer Name
   - Farmer name from profile automatically used in insurance context
   - Appears on insurance certificates and premium cards
   - Fallback to default if not provided

3. Farm Size as Insurance Fallback
   - Profile farm size converted to hectares for insurance calculations
   - Used as fallback when not specified in user prompt
   - Intelligent conversion: Small (<1 acre) â†’ 0.4ha, Medium (1-5) â†’ 2.0ha, etc.

Technical Implementation:

dialog_agricultural_profile.xml:
- Added EditText for farmer name with proper styling
- Positioned before state/farm size for logical flow
- Hint text: 'Enter your name for insurance documents'
- Updated helper text to explain insurance benefit

MainActivityFSM.kt:
- Enhanced profile dialog to capture and save farmer name
- Updated getUserAgriculturalProfile() to include farmer_name field
- Modified createEnrichedContext() to send farmer_name and farm_size_hectares
- Added convertFarmSizeToHectares() for automatic hectare conversion

Data Flow:
1. Profile Setup: User â†’ Dialog â†’ SharedPreferences
2. Message Send: Profile â†’ Context â†’ FSM Agent
3. Insurance: FSM uses farmer_name + farm_size_hectares for personalized docs

Benefits:
- Personalized insurance documents with proper farmer names
- Smart farm size fallback for consistent calculations
- Single profile setup serves multiple purposes
- Privacy-conscious (farmer name is optional)
- Professional insurance certificates
