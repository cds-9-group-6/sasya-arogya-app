feat: Add smart insurance quick action with profile-based prompt generation

User Experience Enhancement for Insurance Queries

Problem:
Users didn't know what prompt to use to get insurance premium quotes.

Solution:
Added intelligent insurance quick action button that:
1. Shows farm size and state from profile
2. Auto-generates proper insurance query when clicked
3. Helps users discover insurance feature easily

Implementation:

1. Smart Welcome Message:
   - Reads user's agricultural profile
   - Creates personalized insurance quick action
   - Shows farm size in hectares and state name
   
   Examples:
   - With profile: "Get Insurance Quote (2.0 ha farm in Karnataka)"
   - Without profile: "Get Insurance Quote"

2. Intelligent Prompt Generation:
   When insurance quick action clicked:
   - Extracts profile data (state, farm_size)
   - Converts farm size to hectares  
   - Generates natural language query
   - Sends to FSM agent automatically
   
   Generated prompt:
   "I would like to get crop insurance for my 2.0 hectare farm in Karnataka. Please show me premium options."

3. Profile Integration:
   - Uses existing convertFarmSizeToHectares() method
   - Formats hectares with 1 decimal place
   - Falls back to defaults if profile not set

Benefits:

- Discoverability: Users see insurance feature immediately
- Ease of Use: Single click to request insurance
- Personalization: Shows user's actual farm size and location
- Proper Query Format: Backend receives well-formatted request
- Profile Utilization: Demonstrates value of profile setup

User Flow:

1. User with profile (Karnataka, Medium farm):
   - Sees: "Get Insurance Quote (2.0 ha farm in Karnataka)"
   - Clicks -> Sends: "...for my 2.0 hectare farm in Karnataka..."
   - Gets personalized insurance options

2. User without profile:
   - Sees: "Get Insurance Quote"
   - Clicks -> Sends: "...for my 0.4 hectare farm in your state..."
   - Encourages profile setup
