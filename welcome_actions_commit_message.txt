feat: Remove Treatment Guide from welcome message sample actions

- Remove "ðŸ’Š Treatment Guide" from welcome message followUpItems list
- Remove corresponding case handler in handleFollowUpClick() method
- Streamline welcome actions to 7 focused plant care options
- Maintain clean user experience with most essential actions only

BREAKING CHANGE: Users will no longer see Treatment Guide as a quick action
in the welcome message, though treatment information is still available
through other interaction flows.

- app/src/main/java/com/sasya/arogya/MainActivityFSM.kt

This change simplifies the initial user experience while keeping the most
commonly used plant care actions readily accessible from the welcome screen.
